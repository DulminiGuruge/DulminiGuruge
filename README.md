### Hi there 👋

<!--
**DulminiGuruge/DulminiGuruge** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- 🔭 The project I am currently working on involves developing the front-end and REST API for a web application designed for a restaurant.
- 🌱 I am excited to be part of the ever-evolving world of cloud computing and currently dedicating my time to learning  AWS cloud architecture.
- 👯 Always on the lookout for exciting projects to collaborate on during my free time. If you have an idea or project that you think I can contribute to, let's work together and bring it to life!
